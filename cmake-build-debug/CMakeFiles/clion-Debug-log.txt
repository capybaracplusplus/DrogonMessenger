CMake Warning at AuthService/CMakeLists.txt:47 (target_link_libraries):
  Target "my_drogon_app" requests linking to directory "/usr/local/include".
  Targets may link only to libraries.  CMake is dropping the item.


CMake Warning at AuthService/CMakeLists.txt:17 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target my_drogon_app because
  there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/usr/local/lib]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libredis++.so.1]
    dir 1 is [/mnt/c/Users/dimak/CLionProjects/drogonChat/cmake-build-debug/AuthService/libs/redis-plus-plus]
      dir 0 must precede it due to runtime library [libredis++.so.1]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
